## A new Beginning

I never grew up interested in computer science and instead I became a baker after going to culinary school. However, the pandemic laid me off and during my free time I fell in love with video games again and it sparked an interest in me that I never knew I had. What if I went into programming or something in the video game design field? I started off doing some courses online at codeAcademy and surprisingly it was enjoyable. I remember the first computer science class I took was ICS 111 and when we first did the infamous "Hello World" assignment. Even though it was fairly simple and easy, the concept of inputing a code to get an output fascinated me and I got excited thinking about the endless possibilities coding could offer. I was terrified of suddenly going from baking to computer science but I knew if I put in time and effort then I will slowly start to familiarize myself with a new enviornment. 

## To the Future

As I do not have a of experience in software engineering, I am excited to learn more about implementing concepts and also more about Typescript. I mainly just used jGrasp, Java, and gitHub so far but I want to familiarize myself with other languages such as C++ and Python. I want to figure out if I prefer front-end over back-end development and what my favorite programming language to work with is. Being surrounded by fellow peers that has similar interests with me also gives me the drive to become a better software engineer for the future.

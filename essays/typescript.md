## Typescript, a new programming language


This is my first time using typescript but I am enjoying it so far because it is very simple and straight forward. I have only used it for less than two weeks but it seems it catches errors faster than javascript. I find my code looks more organized and I think typescript would be superior in a real life work setting with multiple people working on the same project. Finding errors faster means less confusion when working by yourself or more people. Typescript feels like an updated version of javascript and I am excited to be more comfortable using it.



## Practice, practice, practice


Learning through lectures and watching your professor solve problems limit our ability to improve on our coding skills. The practice WOD's are helpful and this style of learning is more hands on so I think I'm able to retain and use what I learned more effectively. We are also timed during the WOD's which will prep us to work under pressure because in the real world we will have to finish within a deadline. I also like that the use of AI is not prohibited because in the real world we should be able to use all of the tools available to us efficiently.

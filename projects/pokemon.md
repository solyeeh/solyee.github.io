summary: "Pokemon GUI that resembles a Pokemon Go."
---


For the final project of ICS 111, I had to make a pokemon GUI that acted like a Pokemon Go. You could catch a pokemon and once caught, it would display a data structure such as the name, HP, and CP. If you were unable to catch the pokemon then it would output that the pokemon fleed. It would also save all of the pokemon you caught or didn't catch and you had the option of displaying all of the pokemon. 

This was the first big project that I had in my coding career. We implemented all of the things we learned throughout the course of the semester such as how to implement sorting, seperate data structures, and use our own sorting methods such as the Java List sort method. When the user "threw" the pokeball, it would randomly generate the option to either catch the pokemon and save it into the caught pokemon array or have it escape. I got to implement the toString() method for all of the pokemon the user caught.

As someone who enjoyed watching and playing pokemon, it was fun having my first project be related to something that I grew up watching.

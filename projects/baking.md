In 2016-2019, I was the lead baker at the restaurant, Moku Kitchen. This position allowed me to foster and use leadership skills for the first time. I was in charge of making sure all of the products we were making were of top quality. The bakeshop has rougly 3-5 people I managed with two different stations (bread and pies) so it was crucial that everyone worked together to make sure we were being efficient.

Everyday I had to make sure we were following our par and maintained the quality of products that we were known for. I got to interview new bakers for the first time when we had to hire someone and it was interesting being on the other side of the table for once. It showed me how to look for good qualities in a person within just 15 minutes of our interview. I also took pride in how clean the bakeshop was and it showed how organized we were as a team. Time-management and multitasking is crucial for bakers because most of the time we have multiple things going on at once.

This position allowed me to grow out of my shell and take more of a leadership role. It showed me how to work with different people and how to utilize everyone's strengths and weaknesses to better work as a team.

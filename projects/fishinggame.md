summary: "Fishing tournament game for a Final project in ICS 211"
---



In ICS 211, I developed a fishing tournament game with two other classmates. During the first phase of the tournament, we had a fish pond with all of the different types of baby fishes that would grow for about two years. Then, the actual playing part of the tournament was for one year where two players would alternate turns. After each player has a turn, one month would be over and it would move on to the next month until the year has been passed. Each month the fish will eat and grow and a player has a maximum total to try catch a fish three times. Each attempt can either give a result of no fish caught, a fish caught and kept (if it is the correct size), or a fish caught and it being not the correct size in which the player would be penalized by having all of their fish taken away. The winner was decided after comparing the two players' lists and the sum of the three largests fish lengths.

The game taught me valuable lessons in teamwork because each person had to be responsible for their own fish class. There were a total of four fish families and each family had different legal sizes, month availability, and catch methods. This was the first project where I really felt like I had to practice my communication skills because we needed to make sure all of our implementations were correct. There were many subclasses so my teammates and I tried to be organized in order to not mix up any of the fishes in the repository. 

I enjoyed this project and building teamwork was a skill that was constantly reinforced from making the game to doing the group code review for other groups.
